agent_subtypes_onscreen_name_override_grudgebringer_cavalry_officer	Commander	true
agent_subtypes_description_text_override_grudgebringer_cavalry_officer	Morgan was born and raised in the imperial city of Nuln, famed for its Gunnery School, Master Engineers and all things gunpowder. The city was a paradise for many, but for Morgan it was a banal and unchanging city, mired in conduct and blinded by its own decadence. Being the eldest son in his family, he was sent away to the officers academy, as was the custom for the City.\\n\\nHe spent four long years learning the intricacies of battle, swordsmanship and of course, artillery. The long studying of formations and artillery bored him senseless and he gained a reputation as an exceptional, yet troublesome student, as he failed to show up for most classes, feeling that his skills were outpacing the curriculum.\\n\\nFor Bernheardt, it was the Cavalry where his true passions lay, he was said to be able to outride even the Reiksguard knights whenever they passed the great city and was well known for goading his fellow nobles into races and other such events where horses and wagers were involved.\\n\\nHis disregard for the rules, reckless behaviour and lust for adventure eventually got him expelled from the academy, much to Bernhardt’s relief, though this would haunt him for years to come, as he was denied entry from every knightly order in the Empire he attempted to join, even the Pistoliers would have nothing to do with his insubordination (much to the delight of his former peers and teachers).\\n\\nThis is how Morgan Bernhardt got the Grudgebringer. A young Morgan Bernhardt had failed several times to become part of the Empire's knightly orders and went to drown his sorrows in a inn. After some drunken back and forth with the patrons of the bar, Morgan gave a inspiring speech about forming an army better than knightly order.\\n\\nThis impressed the patrons that they offered to be the first soldiers of the Grudgebringers company. A eccenric old Bright wizard (a wizard skilled in the Lore of Fire) then comes and declares his admiration, since he's too old to join and fight he gives Bernhard his magical sword, the Grudgebringer and tells him to make good use of it.\\n\\nMorgan's mercenaries have enjoyed a properous first year of operation, commanding an unsullied respect on their home turf in the Imperial probvince of the Reikland. The Grudgebringers have since marched to the troubled Border Princes where they hope to join a major campaign to prove themselves worthy of greater fortunes. The Grudgebringers are composed primarily of both cavalry, led by Morgan, and heavy infantry led by Lieutenant Schepke.	true
